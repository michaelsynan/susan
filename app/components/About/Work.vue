        ABOUT THE WORK
      </h1>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-8">
        <strong>I witness and support transformation in people's lives.</strong> As a peer counselor, I see myself as a
        mentor and
        friend, and a doula and guide through life's transitions and transformations. Through conversations, workshops,
        and skill sharing, we will explore healing outside of conventional therapy and the medical-industrial complex.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-8">
        I meet with individuals <strong>up to four times a month</strong> virtually or in person to offer support
        around:

      <ul class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-8 text-left max-w-3xl mx-auto list-disc list-inside">
        <li class="mb-2">Navigating relationships and polyamory</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Gender transition or other identity shifts and major life transitions</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Exploring gender transition, polyamory, or neurodivergent identities for the first time</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Healing from trauma and colonialism</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Experiencing more affirmation and validation for your identities and intersections</li>

        <li class="mb-2">Decolonizing and ancestral trauma healing</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-8">
        Ultimately, my goal is to help people feel joy, expressiveness, self-acceptance, and authenticity through
        exploring their identities, needs, and desires; connecting them with community and a sense of belonging; and
        supporting them in developing a constructive analysis of the systems of oppression that may be creating harm in
        their lives.

        My work is for everyone, but <strong>I strive to center QTBIPOC* and neurodivergent folks.</strong>

        You'll leave our sessions feeling seen and validated, and with <strong>tools</strong>, solid <strong>political

        The power of community & belonging

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-12">
        Being in community can be a life-changing experience. Whether it's through activism, relationships,
        volunteering, or through introspection and literature, I can help you find your people and a sense of belonging.

        Decolonization work, social justice organizing & mutual aid
      </h2>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose mb-8">
        Decolonization work takes a lot of energy, self-education, fucking up, and learning in community. I help people
        navigate and find ways to resist oppression, colonialism, racism, fascism, patriarchy, problematic institutions,
        government, rigidity and the gender binary. I work with folks who are healing ancestral trauma and
        intergenerational wounds.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose">
        I have a special interest in working with folks who want to be involved in social justice organizing and mutual
        aid, and need some help with healing and/or don't know where to start. I also help activists process and manage
        protest trauma and burnout.
