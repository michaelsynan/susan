        A background in community mental health, advocacy, and street medicine
      </h2>

        I have a background working in community mental health, both professionally and through activist and mutual aid
        projects. I am in loving community with folks with neurodivergence and mental health issues – and I also
        experience these issues myself, so I understand what dysregulation feels like, and I have a wide range of tools
        I can share with you. I also have specific experience working with other BIPOC, including folks who have
        recently immigrated to the United States through my organizing work and my job with Chinese American Service
        League.

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-black !leading-loose">
        Social justice and mutual aid are very important to me. In 2012, I went through pre-NATO street medicine
        training in Chicago in preparation for the NATO summit — one of the first mass actions. Later, I went to
        Ferguson after Mike Brown was shot to help out as a street medic. In 2014, joined the Chicago Action Medical
        Collective, and I have been a member since.
